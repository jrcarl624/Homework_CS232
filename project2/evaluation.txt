I spent 4 hours and 31 minutes on this in total according to wakatime.

Conner was a good partner he communicated well, with myself having more experience I let him have a go at debugging before I stepped in to debug, so he could gain some experience at diagnosing problems. I found the problem and fixed it after some tweaking to index page. Overall conner did pretty well, communicated well and overall it was a good experience.
